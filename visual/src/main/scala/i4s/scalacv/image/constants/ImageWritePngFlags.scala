/** Imwrite PNG specific flags used to tune the compression algorithm.
 * These flags will be modify the way of PNG image compression and will be passed to the underlying zlib processing stage.
 * <p>
 * -   The effect of IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_FILTERED is to force more Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_DEFAULT and IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_HUFFMAN_ONLY.
 * -   IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_RLE is designed to be almost as fast as IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.
 * -   The strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
 * -   IMWRITE_PNG_STRATEGY_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special applications.
